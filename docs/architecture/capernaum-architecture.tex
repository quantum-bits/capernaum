\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\caper{} is a web-based system
that gathers respones to designated surveys taken at \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/}{Qualtrics}.
When notified of a completed survey by a Qualtrics web hook,
\caper{}
downloads the survey response
to its \href{https://www.postgresql.org/}{\pg{}} relational database
using the
\href{https://api.qualtrics.com/}{Qualtrics RESTful API}.
\caper{} then
analyzes the response and
prepares a personalized analysis for the respondent:
a \LaTeX-formatted PDF containing both a text commentary
and graphical visualizations of results.
Finally, \caper{}
emails the PDF to the survey respondent.

The main customer for \caper{}
is Taylor University's
\href{https://www.taylor.edu/center-for-scripture-engagement/}{Center for Scripture Engagement}
(\cfse).
As part of a faith-based institution,
the \cfse{} publishes the
\href{https://www.taylor.edu/center-for-scripture-engagement/survey/}{Christian Life Survey}
(\cls)
at Qualtrics.
\caper{} provides analysis and reporting on survey results
for individual respondents and
can also aggregate responses for groups of users.

Traffic to the \cls{} is driven primarily by a partnership between \cfse{} and
\href{https://www.biblegateway.com/}{Bible Gateway}.
Bible Gateway is one of the most-visited Christian web site on the Internet.
In October, 2021, it was the
\href{https://www.similarweb.com/website/biblegateway.com/}{632-nd most visited site in the world,
  with 80~million visits}.
Although only a fraction of Bible Gateway users take the \cls,
the potential user volume is a key factor in the design of \caper.
In particular, \caper{} employs a distributed job queuing system
for analysis and production of survey analyses,
designed to scale to handle 2,000 survey responses per minute.

\section{Deployment}
\label{sec:deployment}

\caper{} employs a fully-automated deployment
using \href{https://www.ansible.com/}{Ansible}.
The \ghsrc{ansible/provision.yaml}{provisioning file} contains commands for GitHub, OS updates, etc.
