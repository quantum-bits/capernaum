  <p>Example message to your group members:</p>

  <p>Dear {{ name }}:</p>

  <p>
    I’m excited to share with you the link and group code (see below) for the
    Christian Life Survey. The CLS is designed to give you new ways to think
    about your walk with God and will provide you insights into your spiritual
    priorities and areas of focus that can help you engage better with
    Scripture. The survey is free.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most people need from 15 to 25 minutes to complete the survey. You’ll
    receive your personal results by email within a few minutes. Your answers
    will not be shared with anyone other than you. I will get averages for our
    group and your results might be included in aggregate results (results for
    thousands of people all joined together) reported by the Center for
    Scripture Engagement, but only you will see your individual results.
  </p>

  <p>Here is the information you need to know to take the survey.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ tuClsUrl }}">Link </a> to the survey at Taylor University's
      web site
      <span> ( {{ tuClsUrl }} ) </span>
      (scroll down and click on "Take Survey")
    </li>
    <li>
      When you are asked if you want to take an individual survey or the group
      survey, select group survey by entering our <strong>group code</strong>:
      {{codeWord}}
    </li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Go To Survey</strong> button.</li>
    <li>You must take the survey by midnight on {{ closedAfter }}.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I’m looking forward to talking to you about the survey.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>{{ adminFirstName }} {{ adminLastName }}</p>
